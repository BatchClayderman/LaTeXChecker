# LaTeXChecker

This is an implementation for checking LaTeX source files in the mode of multiple typesetting styles for one manuscript. 

## checkCite.py (LaTeXChecker v1.0)

This script is used to check the LaTeX files without understanding the LaTeX files. 

This script will no longer be under maintenance. 

Please use the later versions. 

## checkLaTeX.py (LaTeXChecker v1.1 - v1.9)

This script is used to check the LaTeX files, supporting complex structures. 

Here are some incomplete implementations based on baseline ideas. 

### v1.3

In this version, some functions are accomplished. 

However, it is not an optimal way to handle LaTeX checking tasks. 

This version of the script cannot run. It acts as a thought provider here. 

### v1.5

The ``Pointer`` and the ``Structure`` are separated. 

Compared with ``v1.3``, the codes are more readable and the thought is more feasible. 

This version of the script cannot run. It acts as a thought provider here. 

### v1.7

This is the first version for handling complex structures that can be executed directly. 

## LaTeXChecker (LaTeXChecker v2.0)

This is the initial version of ``LaTeXChecker.py`` that supports complex structures with understanding the LaTeX files.
