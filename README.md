# checkCite

This is a set of small toolkits that I use most. 

## adjustCalendar.py

This script can help handle some calendar issues in bulk. 

It can be used to remove online course arrangements from the calendar. 

## aobiAdb.py

This script is used for Android automatic control based on uiautomator2. 

Currently, this script is no longer under maintenance due to some limitations. 

This script cannot follow the Android screen in real time. 

No multiple points are supported while I expect to have ``p1, p2 = Point(), Point()``, ``p1.click(x, y)``, ``p2.wrap(x1, y1, x2, y2)``, and ``Point.commit(p1, p2)``. 

## checkCite.py

This script is used to check the LaTeX files without understanding the LaTeX files. 

This script will no longer be under maintenance. 

Please use the later versions. 

## checkLaTeX.py

This script is used to check the LaTeX files, supporting complex structures. 

### v1.0

Please refer to ``checkCite.py``. 

### v1.3

In this version, some functions are accomplished. 

However, it is not an optimal way to handle LaTeX checking tasks. 

This version of the script cannot run. It acts as a thought provider here. 

### v1.5

The ``Pointer`` and the ``Structure`` are separated. 

Compared with ``v1.3``, the codes are more readable and the thought is more feasible. 

This version of the script cannot run. It acts as a thought provider here. 

### v2.0

This is the initial version of ``checkLaTeX.py`` that supports complex structures with understanding the LaTeX files. 

## WinOS.py

This script is a tool used very frequently on the Windows platform.
